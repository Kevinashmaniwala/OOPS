        "Q-1:What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "->object oriented programming is a programming style in python in which we arrange the code using object and class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-2:  What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->class basically is a blueprint, we can make object through it, for example \"car\" is a class and we can make defferent cars (objects) like tata safari, mahindra tuv, suzuki alto etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-3:What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->object in oop is a real world entity made from class like phone is a class and i phone, samsung and xiaomi are objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-4:What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "->abstraction and encapsulation both methods are related to hinding but there is difference between both methods while abstraction hides only unneeded details and complex implementation and encapsulation binds data and method and we can make private data or can make it private using \"__\" to private or \"_\" to protect\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->dunder method or magical/special method in python are the method defined by built in class in python we define this type of methods for creating custom objects and implementing operator overloading in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "->inheritance is basically a same concept as in real life but in oop derived class inherits from base class, when a derived class inherits it can access the method from base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->polymorphism is a process in python which refers to an object taking several forms depending on the method or data method overloading and method overriding are the ways of polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->to make an object private use \"__\" before any method variable or \"_\" to protect it\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize an object when it's created.Python uses the init() method to define a constructor.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->class methods are bound to the class and access/modify methods and attributes associated to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "->static method doesn't modify class or instance state, it behavees like a plain function that belongs to a class\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->In Python, if you define multiple methods with the same name in a class, the last definition will override the previous ones. however python doesn't support method overriding in traditional way, but it can be achieved using some methods e.g. (*args), (**kwargs)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->method overloading in python refers to an object taking several forms depending on the method/data. method overloading happens in thebsame class and the last method overloads previous ones in the same class\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->property decorators allow you to use class method as attribute and make code look neat and well organized\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that significantly enhances code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->abstract class is a concept of hiding complex implementation, hiding unneeded details and exposing the data only which is required and also abstract class can not be instantiated it always remain in subclass\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->object oriented program is a programming style in which we arrange the code using object and class it makes code easy to access and also make it clean and decorates it and codes flexibility and reusability increases using oop system\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "->class variable are defined insida a class and they can be call from the class name and they share same name for all instances\n",
        "\n",
        "instance variables are unique variable they are defined as init with self keyword and they don't share data across all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->multiple inheritance in python is same im real world when a class inherits from 2 or more classes it is called multiple inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-19. Explain the purpose of \"__str_ and repr.\" methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "->in python \" str, repr\" are dunder or magic/special method use to make code loook more clean and user friendly when str is use to make an object is an way that is easily understandable and repr is use when you need a precise representation that can represent the code and this is developer friendly it helps to debug the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-20. What is the significance of the super()' function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->The super() function in Python is used to call a method from the parent (superclass) in a child (subclass). It is mainly used in inheritance to reuse methods of the parent class without explicitly naming it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-21. What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->del is use to cleanup objects after they are used and no longer needed and other use of it is to close the file after use and many more...\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->@classmethod is bound to the class and can only access or modigy methods and attributes associated to the class\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod does not modify class or instance state it behaves like a plain function that belomgs to a class it does not access instance or class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Polymorphism means \"one interface, multiple implementations\"â€”a function or method can behave differently for different classes. When combined with inheritance, polymorphism allows a child class to override a parent class method with its own custom behavior.\n",
        "Q-24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "->Method Chaining in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line. This is achieved by making each method return self, so the next method can be called directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q-25. What is the purpose of the __call_. method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "->In Python, the call() method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. This makes objects behave like functions, providing a flexible way to execute logic.\n",
